Move luaL_checkudata to use an ILuaBase method if it is ever added

StringTable::FindString -- Search for string equal to contents, rather than having to iterate within Lua

Perhaps bring out some table modification functions, table creation functions and table callback creation

It'll probably explode if ran in both the client state and menu state.. although maybe not.
