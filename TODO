Allocate userdata to some struct (Maybe GarrysMod::Lua::UserData, but I ain't a fan of it. Although Garry gives us no choice but to do that and hope everyone else does the same becauEW OSE THE FUCKING luaL_checkudata LACK)
Userdata typechecks so that we don't crash when a StringTable object isn't passed to our metamethods

StringTable::FindString -- Search for string equal to contents, rather than having to iterate within Lua

Perhaps bring out some table modification functions, table creation functions and table callback creation

It'll probably explode if ran in both the client state and menu state.. although maybe not.
